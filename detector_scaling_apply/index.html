Documentation for SIR DetectorScaling
In this document, you will find the documentation for Euclid’s SIR DetectorScaling module as well as documentation for the underlying Python classes. The detector scaling module provides four primary functions:
	1	It corrects the input spectroscopic image, for each detector, by dividing it with the corresponding 2D calibration map.
	2	Sets all the pixels with inf values with NaNs, flags them as invalid and updates the mask layer.
Module Usage
The full details of the latest command-line usage documentation can always be found, using the command:
E-Run SIR_Pipeline SIR_DetectorScaling --help
In summary, the most important command-line switches and arguments, when running the module in stand-alone mode, are:
Inputs and Outputs
--workdir WORKDIR
The root working directory where all of the files are located.
--config CONFIG
The name of the configuration file, relative to the workdir.
--sci_frame_fits FRAME
The name of a FITS file containing exposures from all 16 detectors, relative to the workdir.
----zodiacal_light ZODI
A FITS file with the zodiacal light model, relative to the workdir.
--mdb MDB
The Mission Database XML file, containing all key instrument and mission parameters, relative to the workdir.
----output_frame_fits OUTPUT
The name of the flat-fielded output FITS file which will contain corrected images for all 16 detectors, relative to the workdir.
