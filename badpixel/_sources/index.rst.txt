NIR Bad Pixel Masking
=====================

The component identifier is **NIR_BadPixelMasking**
The module will apply a mask of bad and unreliable pixels to each data frame in the near-infrared detectors.

It contains 9 processing functions (PFs):

1. **Bad Pixel Mask Module** - apply bad pixel mask to data frames.
2. **Bad Pixel Mask Creation Module** - create the bad pixel mask.
3. **Find the Dead Pixel Module** - identify the dead (dis-connected) pixels.
4. **Find the Hot Pixel Module** - identify the hot pixels.
5. **Find the Zero QE Pixel Module** - identify the zero QE pixels.
6. **Find the Low QE Pixel Module** - identify the low QE pixels.
7. **Find the Super QE Pixel Module** - identify the super QE pixels.
8. **Find the High and Low Baseline Pixel Module** - identify pixels that are outside the baseline.
9. **Find the Saturation Pixel Module** - identify the saturated pixels.

Bad Pixels Maksing Module
-------------------------
This PF applies a mask of bad and unreliable pixels in the near-infrared detectors.
It applies the mask to each data frame. This PF only masks pixels that are identified
as bad by the bad pixel calibration modules.  This PF does not mask pixels with low transmittance,
high dark current, non-linear pixels or pixels that are affected by persistence from pervious exposures.
These will be flagged by other PFs if they violat their calibration margins.  The 
image combination PF will determine if a pixel is usable for a given science product.  

Create Bad Pixels Mask Module
-----------------------------
This PF is part of the bad pixel calibration module.  It creates a mask for the bad pixels 
in the near-infrared detectors.  It makes a list of bad pixels based on the 
detector data obtained from flight, which consists of data with dis-connected pixels,
zero-fluence pixels, hot pixels, zero QE pixles, saturated pixels and pixels outside the baseline.
From here, it then creats a Fits file with binary tables.

Requirements
------------
The primary requirements are R-NIR-PRD-F-001, R-NIR-PRD-F-002, R-NIR-PRC-F-002 and R-NIR-MSK-F-001.
