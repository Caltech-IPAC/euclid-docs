   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Documentation for SIR DetectorScalingCalibration
============================================

In this document, you will find the documentation for Euclid's SIR DetectorScalingCalibration module 
as well as documentation for the underlying Python classes. This module derives a pixel-wise multiplication correction factor to the detector response to a uniform illumination and is tailored to each detector. This multiplication factor, generated as a 2D map, is needed as input by the SIR DetectorScaling (apply) module under SIR Pipeline. 


Module Usage
============

The full details of the latest command-line usage documentation can always be found, using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    E-Run SIR_Calibration SIR_DetectorScalingCalibration --help

In summary, the most important command-line switches and arguments, when running the module in stand-alone mode, are:

Inputs and Outputs
----------------------

``--workdir WORKDIR``
     The root working directory where all of the files are located.

``--config CONFIG``
    The name of the configuration file, relative to the ``workdir``.

``--logdir LOGDIR``   
    The name of the logging directory, relative to the ``workdir``.

``--mdb MDB``
    The Mission Database XML file, containing all key instrument and mission parameters, relative to the ``workdir``.

``----outfile OUTPUT``
    The name of the output FITS file, containing 2D weighted QE maps, for all 16 detectors, for both RGS and BGS grisms, relative to 
    the ``workdir``.
